			Sanjay comes from a family of coders. His parents
			started up in the late 80s - their company Softrade 
			has now been building bullet-proof code for over 
			25 years. Having done his undergraduate thesis in 
			Natural Language Processing (Python/SQL) and then 
			working at an iBank where he automated various systems, 
			code runs in his blood. He is very into minimalist 
			design, iOS and the web.
